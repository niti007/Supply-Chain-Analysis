# Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

# Task

Peter Pandey is the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined AtliQ Mart recently. He has been briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting. Now imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and play the role of the new data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task:

1. Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in comic form.
3. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

# Important Insights from the Dashboard 

1. Average OT%, IF%, and OTIF% are noticeably lower than the targeted levels.
2. Acclaimed Stores, Lotus Mart, Vijay Stores, Rel Fresh, Cool Blue, and Propel Mart seem to be the key customers as they have almost 53% of the total orders.
3. On May 22 and Aug 22 there is a slight improvement in IF% and OTIF% but still they are very far from the target.
4. The Total orders for AM milk 250 are the most still a lot of times it is delayed.
5. OTIF% for  Acclaimed Stores-15.47% , Lotus Mart-16.34% , Cool Blue-13.75% which is quite alarming.
6. Also OTIF for acclaimed stores which have the most orders out of all customers in Surat is only 6.93%
7. out of 32k orders only 9.2k orders are delivered on time in full.

    
# The supply chain analysis project provided several insights and domain knowledge related to the supply chain domain. Here are some of the key takeaways and learned things from this project:

1. Understanding of Service Level Metrics: This project helped in understanding the significance of service level metrics such as On-time delivery (OT) %, In-full delivery (IF) %, and On-Time In Full (OTIF) %, and their importance in maintaining customer satisfaction and retention.

2. Identifying Key Customers and Products: Analyzing customer and product data provided insights into the importance of identifying key customers and products. Understanding the performance and behavior of key customers and products can help in prioritizing resources and addressing potential issues in the supply chain.

3. Challenges in Maintaining Service Levels: The project emphasized the challenges faced in maintaining service levels, especially in terms of on-time and in-full deliveries. It showcased how even with high order volumes, ensuring timely and complete deliveries can be a complex task, requiring careful monitoring and management.

4. Impact of Supply Chain Issues on Customer Relationships: The project highlighted the impact of supply chain issues on customer relationships. Inadequate service levels can lead to dissatisfaction and the potential loss of key customers, emphasizing the importance of addressing supply chain issues promptly and effectively.

6. Performance Discrepancies Across Locations and Customers: The project illustrated the discrepancies in performance across different locations and customers. It emphasized the need to tailor supply chain strategies based on specific customer requirements and regional dynamics, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective.

7. Tracking and Monitoring Performance Trends Over Time: By monitoring performance trends over time, the project emphasized the importance of tracking supply chain performance consistently. This allows for the identification of seasonal variations, recurring issues, and improvements, enabling proactive measures to enhance overall service levels.
