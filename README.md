# Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

# Task

Peter Pandey is the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined AtliQ Mart recently. He has been briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting. Now imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and play the role of the new data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task:

1. Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in comic form.
3. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

# Learned things from the project
    
- Acquired a comprehensive understanding of calculating RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) and its significance in assessing a hotel's revenue performance.
- Gained insights into utilizing RevPAR to establish accurate room pricing strategies and to benchmark the performance of hotels against other properties or brands.
- Explored the calculation of DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights) as a key metric for understanding the average daily room bookings over a specified period.
- Investigated the significance of DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) in assessing the average number of rooms available for sale on a daily basis within a specific time frame.
- Explored the calculation of DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights) and its role in evaluating the average number of rooms effectively used by customers on a daily basis over a defined period.
